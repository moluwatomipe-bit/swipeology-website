    <h1>Swipeology Data Deletion Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>This Data Deletion Policy explains how Swipeology handles user data when a deletion request is made. We are committed to respecting your privacy and giving you control over your information.</p>

    <h2>1. How to Request Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You may request deletion of your data in two ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>By deleting your account directly in the Swipeology app</li>
      <li>By emailing us at <strong>swipeologyapp@gmail.com</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. What Happens When You Delete Your Account</h2>
    <p>When you request deletion, we remove or anonymize the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your account information</li>
      <li>Your profile details</li>
      <li>Your photos</li>
      <li>Your matches</li>
      <li>Your messages (deleted or anonymized)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Most data is removed from active systems within 30 days. Some information may remain in secure backups for a limited period as required for security, fraud prevention, or legal compliance.</p>

    <h2>3. Verification</h2>
    <p>For security, we may verify your identity before processing a deletion request.</p>

    <h2>4. Irreversible Action</h2>
    <p>Once your data is deleted, it cannot be recovered. You will need to create a new account if you return to Swipeology.</p>

    <h2>5. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about data deletion or need help, contact us at:</p>
